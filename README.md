Jackson Morgan:
 	-- Sorta fixed error where same enemy would always spawn when you had not spawned a enemy
 	-- made quit game bring you back to title screen so that you could start a new game 
 	-- NEW BUG -- when you start a new game things that should be colored turn white. Game still functions.
 	-- NEW BUG -- enemies used to respond to what you spawned spawing in your lane and spawning one of a few soldier types. Now the same enemy keeps being spawned in seemingly random places.
	-- New AI idea -- tally the range, strength, and speed of the incoming row. Deploy unit that responds best to variable with max value.

	- NO NEW BUGS were created

	-Made new class chose functions (2/3)  way done
        -When implimented due to spawning times almost always spawns same enemy(must be fixed)

Jackson Morgan:
	-Fixed issue where A.I. spawned one type of enemy much more often than other types.
        - made the game pause and resume again, but in doing so:
	- NEW BUG: quit game is broken, breaks everytime pause and resume gets fixed
	- Made it so when you lose the game you can go back to the main menu.
	- Made it so that you can proceed to a new game once you win a game.
