Jackson Morgan:
 	-- Sorta fixed error where same enemy would always spawn when you had not spawned a enemy
 	-- made quit game bring you back to title screen so that you could start a new game 
 	-- NEW BUG -- when you start a new game things that should be colored turn white. Game still functions.
 	-- NEW BUG -- enemies used to respond to what you spawned spawing in your lane and spawning one of a few soldier types. Now the same enemy keeps being spawned in seemingly random places.
	-- New AI idea -- tally the range, strength, and speed of the incoming row. Deploy unit that responds best to variable with max value.
