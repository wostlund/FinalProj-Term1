# FinalProj-Term1
Final Project for my first term of APCS


1-Project Description <br>
Our project is a strategy game based off warlords call to arms. In the beginning 
of each round you can buy and upgrade units. Then start the battle. Each soldier type has different stats and spawn time.
This is where the strategy comes in. There are two main types of enemies, ranged and melee. Ranged enemies are slower
but can attack from afar. Melee enemies are faster, but have to attack up close. The goal is to get your soldiers to the other end.
When you do your score goes up one, and the enemy score decreases by one. Whoever gets to 50 first wins.<br>
2-Directions to compile/run<br>
This is very simple. You open processing and click play. <br>
3-Directions to use it.<br>
You use the mouse to pick options like start game or buy units.<br>
When it the game you use the arrow keys and the enter key. The left and right keys allow you to select the unit of your choice. <br>
The up and down keys allow you to cycle through your lanes. <br>
The enter key spawns the selected unit in the selected lane. <br>
You can only spawn the units if your box turns blue of if the selected circle turns blue.
This indicates that you are past the spawn time required to spawn you soldiers.<br>

There are also cheat codes if you, like us, cannot win. <br>

CHEAT CODES: <br>
The 'i' key wins the game for you. <br>
The 'o' key will lose the game for you.<br>
The 'p' key will increase your score.<br>
The 'l' key will decrease your code.<br>
The Konami Code will find you cleaning bathrooms for the company as it stops game development in favor of pachinko <br>
machines. Just kidding, it doesn't do anything. <br>
